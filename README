====================================README====================================
Configuration is handled in either a system wide configuration file placed at:

	/etc/pyvimeo.cfg
	
	or a user based configuration file at:
	
	~/.pyvimeo
	

The sections available for configuring are:

	[Credentials]
	api_key = <vimeo api key>
	shared_secret = <vimeo shared secret>
	
	[Urls]
	starndard_api_url = http://www.vimeo.com/api/rest/
	upload_url = http://www.vimeo.com/services/upload/
	auth_url = http://www.vimeo.com/services/auth/
	

Whatever is in the ~/.pyvimeo user file will override whatever is stored in
the system /etc/pyvimeo.cfg file.
